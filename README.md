# Election-to-choose-a-new-president
Simulate a two-round election using MPI. Given voter preferences, determine the winning candidate and in which round they win. Generate a preferences file, divide the file among processes for parallel computation, and display election steps, winner, and candidate percentages per round. Each process loads its part of the file.
